# SUMMARY

What I feel most comfortable is that lambda can directly use local temporary variables, and it is very troublesome to write functions by itself. Especially when writing multi-threading, if there is variable capture, the parameters are very simple, neither the whole global variable nor the self-defining structure.

So many memory management problems are gone, and there are a lot of pits.
<br>
But when I firt knew this expression from class, it confused me and I also think that it may be a little confusing for developers who are good at JAVA. 
<br>
This is not good for maintaining if the people don't know much about Java 8. But once people know how to use it, it's really a save of time and it's very clear.
